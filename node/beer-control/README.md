This app allows you to control electronic beer taps.  To run it, do 'npm start'.  You should see this UI:

![LED Beer Taps](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5796/23654331246_adbd49bca0_k_d.jpg "Beer control GUI")

The status column shows the current pulse count and the calibrated value.  The reset link will reset the pulse count to the calibrated value.  To set a custom pulse count, use the input box and "set" link.
