spark
=====
Repository for spark.io and related code.

The gist of this project is that the spark core (http://spark.io) firmware (see the firmware dir) runs on one or more devices and the node server controls them via the spark API.  You'll need to flash each of your spark cores with the firmware, then run the node server.  The control.html page is mobile friendly so you can control your lighting from your phone.

See the README in each subdirectory for a more detailed description of its contents.
