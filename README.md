Spark.io and Node.js controlled neopixels

Overview
========
Control neopixel LED strips connected to one or more Spark Core (http://spark.io) processors with a web interface.  You can use this to control various parts of your house lighting, an art project or whatever else you want to program.

You'll need to flash each of your cores with the firmware, then run the node.js server on a computer with access to the internet.  

See the README in each subdirectory for a more detailed description of its contents.
